The project focuses on building a scalable system for collecting and processing differ-
ent types of simulated data streamed from three IoT devices such as cars, heart rate
sensors and thermostats, and store that in database using different measurements
for each device.

Project Feature:
Features of the Project
• Simulates data for 3 IoT devices as per project needs
• Publishes data to Kafka topic for real-time processing
• Stores data to InfluxDB for time-series analysis
• Provides APIs for querying statistics (e.g average/median/max/min values)
of specific vehicle or groups of vehicles for a specific timeframe from InfluxDB
• Utilizes micro services

2 Architecture
The project consists of several interconnected components that collectively handles
IoT vehicle data. Each component serves a distinct purpose in the data pipeline.The
architecture illustrated in the Figure 9 shows the flow of data and interactions among
the components
• IoT Data Simulation: Simulates data generated by three IoT devices
• API Microservices: This segment provides a robust API that accepts incoming
payloads and supports querying the stored data from InfluxDB
• Kafka Producer: The Kafka Producer plays an important role in the project
by publishing the simulated IoT data to a designated Kafka topic. This data,
resembling real-time sensor readings, is made available for consumption by
kafka consumer
• Kafka Consumer: The Kafka Consumer is responsible for retrieving data from
the Kafka topic and subsequently storing it in the InfluxDB database
• InfluxDB: InfluxDB serves as the data repository. It stores the real-time vehicle
data streamed from the Kafka topic. It’s designed to efficiently manage and
retrieve time-series data, making it a suitable choice for IoT applications
